# Float-Image

So guys this is 14th project of my 30 days frontend project challenge 

This is a simple animation when page loaded all the items present in the webpage comes from final position to initial position.

I used HTML, CSS and GSAP which is a library of JavaScript and all the animation is posible due to GSAP.

So must check out JavaScript part.
